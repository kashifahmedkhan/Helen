Check out Demo at : http://thememaple.com/helenium


A how-to guide and general information to help you get the most out of your new theme.

This document covers the installation and use of this theme and often reveals answers to common problems and issues - I encourage you to read this document thoroughly if you are experiencing any difficulties. If you have any questions that are beyond the scope of this document, feel free to pose them in the dedicated support forum.


Getting Started:
To install this theme you must have a working version of WordPress already installed. For information regarding the installation of the WordPress platform, please see the WordPress Codex - http://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress


Installation:
When you are ready to install a theme, you must first upload the theme files and then activate the theme itself. The theme files can be uploaded in two ways:

•WordPress Upload:
Navigate to Appearance > Add New Themes > Upload. Go to browse, and select the zipped theme folder. Hit “Install Now” and the theme will be uploaded and installed.  
Once the theme is uploaded, you need to activate it.
Go to Appearance > Themes and activate your chosen theme.
￼￼
￼•FTP Upload:
Using your FTP program, upload the non-zipped theme folder into the /wp- content/themes/ folder on your server.  
Theme Features: 
The theme comes packed with features that control the layout and extend the functionality of WordPress. This section will document those features and how to use them successfully.


Menus:
You can setup custom menus to configure your site’s navigation. The theme comes with one custom menu location called “Primary Menu” and is located at the very top of the theme.
For menu setup, navigate to the Appearance > Menus page. Enter a name for your menu and add links to the menu by using the options given on the left sidebar. You can manage your menus using the drag and drop functionality. After setting up your menu, select the menu you just created from the theme locations drop-down box and hit the "Save" button.


￼POSTS:
Helenium comes with 4 different post formats: Standard, Video, Gallery and Music Posts. When you're writing a new post choose what format (under title bar) your post are and insert the necessary info.
You can also tailor the looks of your post by going to Appearance > Customise and under Post Settings you can hide/show different elements on the post page.
PAGES
You can go to Appearance > Customize > Page Settings and hide/ show comments and share buttons.
For contact page we recommend the plugin "Contact Form 7" and have done pre-styling for this plugin. When you create your form use the following mark-up:
<p class="tm_input">Your Name (required) [text* your-name] </p>
<p class="tm_input">Your Email (required) [email* your-email] </p>
<p class="tm_input">Subject [text your-subject] </p>
<p class="tm_message">Your Message [textarea your-message] </p>
<p>[submit "Send"]</p>
￼￼

￼POST THUMBNAILS:
Theme uses the WordPress Post Thumbnails function. This way, you can upload one image and WordPress will automatically resize it to all of the various thumbnail sizes used throughout the theme. You should always use images with at least 940px width.
To set a post thumbnail for your post, go to Posts > Add New > Set Featured Image.
The normal upload box will now appear. Upload your image and click "Use as featured image". Now simply close the box.
SHORT CODES (Shortcode = shortcut.):
We recommend Zilla ShortCode Plugin which has lots of shortcodes allowing you to add style content to your site with little effort. Shortcodes can embed files or create objects that would normally require lots of complicated, ugly code in just one line.
Conveniently, the available shortcodes have been included in a one- click menu. When creating a page or post, click the “Insert shortcode” to reveal a list of shortcodes. Choose the functionality you wish to include and click “insert” - this will insert the necessary code for you.
